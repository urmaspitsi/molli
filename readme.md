# Welcome to Molli: explore and analyze atomic structures

## Molli is a work-in-progress project
* Currently provides some useful utility functions for computational chemistry workflows.
* Molli is built on top of [ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) library.

## See examples on:
* How to parse [Gaussian software](https://gaussian.com/opt/) log files.
* How to extract featrures from xyz files.
